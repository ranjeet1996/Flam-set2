For Question 1 NQueen Problem I am giving the process what i have done.
I am trying to place one queen per row.
For each row, try every column.
If the position is safe, place the queen and move to the next row.
If no valid position is found, backtrack (remove the queen and try a new position).
Once all rows are filled without conflict, save the board configuration.
